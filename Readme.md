### Instructions: The objective of this assignment is to wrangle a data set and test the correlation between alcohol consumption and life expectancy. You may work on this assignment in pairs, if you wish. In the Word document where you are expected to write your responses, make sure to first write your full name (or names if working in pair) and the class number at the top of the document. Also, while answering the questions, please write the question number corresponding to your answer.  

- Create a data.world account. Once this is done, login to your data.world account. 

- Search for ‘data wrangling’ in the search bar. Click on the result that corresponds with your class name from the search results that come up. 

- Download the drinks.csv Alcohol consumption data set from https://data.world/adv380j/data- wrangling-exercise to your local system. 

- The drinks.csv file has some problems with its data (e.g., missing values, numeric columns stored as chars, etc.) and need to be cleaned before further use. a) In the Word document, list the data-related issues you see in this data set. b) How will you address each data-related issue? Give justification for why you chose a particular way to address each issue. For example, if you decide to address missing values by removing rows or filling empty data cells, justify your decision. 

- Open drinks.csv in Excel (for Microsoft or Mac users) or Numbers (for Mac users) 

- Address each of the issues identified in 3(a) with the data set within Excel or Numbers. 

- Research the average amount of pure alcohol contained in beer, wine, and spirits and compute the total_litres_of_pure_alcohol column values. Document the source of the final numbers you use for this step. [Hint: Start with finding the average alcohol-by-volume (ABV) and the serving size for each type of drink.] 

- Save your new, cleaned drinks.csv file.  

- Create an Alcohol v Life Expectancy data set in your data.world account. 

-  Upload the cleaned drinks.csv file to the data set. 

-  Investigate the uploaded data using the Data Preview and Column Preview tabs, paying particular attention to Type IRI to verify that your data is stored in the correct data type. Also, ensure there are no missing values in your data set using Number of Empty information. Write your findings in the Word document and include screenshots of the Data Preview and Column Preview. 

-  Give the data set a summary, including descriptions of the data values and what steps you took to clean the data and compute new data columns. Copy and paste the summary into your Word document. 

-  Find the Life Expectancy by country data in https://data.world/adv380j/data-wrangling- exercise . 

-  Investigate the data using the Data Preview and Column Preview tabs. 

-  Decide on an appropriate column to join the Life Expectancy data with your drinks data. 
  
- Go back to your own data set and click the link Launch query tool (top right) to load the query page. 

- Follow the steps in the SPARQL Plan of Attack document at https://data.world/adv380j/data-wrangling-exercise to run the query and join the data. 

- Export the joined data as csv to your local system. 

- Open the joined data in Excel or Numbers. 

- Use a scatterplot to plot the data. Add a trend-line and R2 to the data. Copy and paste the scatterplot with the trend-line and R2 showing to your Word document. 

- What does the data say about alcohol consumption and life expectancy? Briefly describe your findings and conclusions in the Word document. Are there any caveats to what you find in the scatterplot?
